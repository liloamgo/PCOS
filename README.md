**Dataset Information**
This dataset contains physical and clinical parameters used to determine PCOS and infertility related issues. The data was collect from 10 different hospital across Kerala, India.

- **Sl. No**: Unique identifier.
- **Patient File No.**: The number is used by the hospital as a systematic documentation of a patient´s medical history and care during each hospital stay.
- **PCOS (Y/N)**: Does patient have PCOS? (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- **Age (yrs)**: Patient's age.
- **Weight (kg)**: Patient's recorded weight.
- **Height (cm)**: Patient's recorded height.
- **BMI**: *Body mass index (BMI)* is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women.

          Formula: weight (kg) / [height (m)]2
     With the metric system, the formula for BMI is weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Because height is commonly measured in centimeters, divide height in centimeters by 100 to obtain height in meters.
     
    **BMI Categories**:
    * Underweight = <18.5
    * Normal weight = 18.5–24.9
    * Overweight = 25–29.9
    * Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater


- **Blood Group**: 
    * **A+** = 11
    * **A-** = 12
    * **B+** = 13
    * **B-** = 14
    * **O+** =15
    * **O-** = 16
    * **AB+** = 17
    * **AB-** = 18
